📚 Playwright Book Store Automation Framework

A Playwright + TypeScript test automation framework built using Page Object Model (POM), fixtures, and Playwright’s authenticated session setup.

🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   npm install

2. Install Playwright browsers
   npx playwright install

3. Run tests
   npx playwright test

⚙️ Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory:

BASE_URL=https://demoqa.com
USERNAME=book_store123
PASSWORD=BookStore@123
USERID=bf478f5f-114b-4fff-a1e3-cc86c6cef051

🧱 Framework Architecture
The framework follows Page Object Model (POM) and clean separation of concerns.

🧩 Key Components
🔹 Page Object Model (POM)
All UI interactions are encapsulated in pages/
Each page contains:
locators
actions
reusable methods

🔹 Fixtures
Located in fixtures/auth-fixture.ts
Used to inject dependencies like page
Keeps tests clean and reusable

🔹 Tests
Located in tests/
Focus only on test logic and assertions
Use page classes for actions

🔹 Utils
constants.ts → Enums and static values
bookInterface.ts → Type-safe API models

🔐 Authentication Strategy
This framework uses Playwright setup project (auth.setup.ts) for authentication.

How it works:
auth.setup.ts runs first
Performs UI login
Saves session → playwright/.auth/user.json
All other tests reuse this session

🧪 Test Types

🔹 Authenticated Tests
Run with saved session
Skip login
Faster execution

🔹 Login Tests
Run separately
No stored session
Validate:
valid login
invalid login

🧹 Test Cleanup
Books added during tests are removed via afterEach
Ensures:
clean state
repeatable runs

🛠️ Commands
Run all tests
npx playwright test
Run authenticated tests only
npx playwright test --project="Book Store"
Run login tests only
npx playwright test --project=login
Run headed
npx playwright test --headed
